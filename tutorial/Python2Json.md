This is part of a larger project on source code search algorithms.

`python2json.py` will take any python 2.6 (or older) file and return a json document that represents the
abstract syntax tree.
There are a couple of minor problems with it, but for the most part it works.

As an example, let's say we have the following python in
example.py:

```python
x = 1 + 2
print x
```

Invoke the script like so to turn example.py into json:

```bash
python2json.py -f example.py
```

You can also provide the input via stdin:

```bash
cat example.py | python2json.py
```

I find it useful to chain this pretty-printer when debugging:

```bash
cat example.py | python2json.py | python -mjson.tool
```

The pretty-printed result in this case is:

```javascript
