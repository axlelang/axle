title: Quanta, Units, and Conversions
permalink: /tutorial/quanta/

`UnittedQuantity` is the primary case class in `axle.quanta`

The `axle.quanta` package models units of measurement.
Via typeclasses, it implements expected operators like `+ - * over by`,
a unit conversion operator `in`,
and a right associative value constructor `*:`

The "quanta" are
Acceleration, Area, Angle,
[Distance](https://github.com/adampingel/axle/blob/master/axle-core/src/main/scala/axle/quanta/Distance.scala),
[Energy](https://github.com/adampingel/axle/blob/master/axle-core/src/main/scala/axle/quanta/Energy.scala),
Flow, Force, Frequency, Information, Mass, Money, MoneyFlow, MoneyPerForce, Power, Speed, Temperature,
[Time](https://github.com/adampingel/axle/blob/master/axle-core/src/main/scala/axle/quanta/Time.scala),
and Volume.
Axle's values are represented in such a way that a value's "quantum" is present in the type,
meaning that nonsensical expressions like `mile + gram` can be rejected at compile time.

![Distance conversions](/tutorial/images/Distance.svg)

Additionally, various values within the Quantum objects are imported.
This package uses the definition of "Quantum" as "something that can
be quantified or measured".

```scala mdoc:silent
import axle._
import axle.quanta._
import axle.jung._
```

Quanta each define a Wikipedia link where you can find out more
about relative scale:

```scala mdoc
Distance().wikipediaUrl
```

A visualization of each Quantum (like the one for Distance shown above) is produced with:

```scala mdoc:silent
import edu.uci.ics.jung.graph.DirectedSparseGraph
import cats.implicits._
import cats.Show
import spire.algebra.Field
import axle.algebra.modules.doubleRationalModule

implicit val fieldDouble: Field[Double] = spire.implicits.DoubleAlgebra
implicit val distanceConverter = Distance.converterGraphK2[Double, DirectedSparseGraph]

implicit val showDDAt1 = new Show[Double => Double] {
  def show(f: Double => Double): String = f(1d).toString
}

import axle.visualize._

val dgVis = DirectedGraphVisualization[DirectedSparseGraph[UnitOfMeasurement[Distance],Double => Double], UnitOfMeasurement[Distance], Double => Double](distanceConverter.conversionGraph)

import axle.web._
import cats.effect._

dgVis.svg[IO]("Distance.svg").unsafeRunSync()
```

## Units

A conversion graph must be created with type parameters specifying the numeric type to
be used in unitted quantity, as well as a directed graph type that will store the conversion
graph.
The conversion graphs should be placed in implicit scope.
Within each are defined units of measurement which can be imported.

```scala mdoc:silent
implicit val massConverter = Mass.converterGraphK2[Double, DirectedSparseGraph]
import massConverter._

implicit val powerConverter = Power.converterGraphK2[Double, DirectedSparseGraph]
import powerConverter._

//implicit val energyConverter = Energy.converterGraphK2[Double, DirectedSparseGraph]
//import energyConverter._

import axle.algebra.modules.doubleRationalModule

// distanceConverter defined above
import distanceConverter._

implicit val timeConverter = Time.converterGraphK2[Double, DirectedSparseGraph]
import timeConverter._
```

Standard Units of Measurement are defined:

```scala mdoc
gram

foot

meter
```

## Construction

Values with units are constructed with the right-associative `*:` method on any spire `Number` type
as long as a spire `Field` is implicitly available.

```scala mdoc
10d *: gram

3d *: lightyear

5d *: horsepower

3.14 *: second

200d *: watt
```

## Conversion

A Quantum defines a directed graph, where the UnitsOfMeasurement
are the vertices, and the Conversions define the directed edges.
See the [Graph](/tutorial/graph/) package for more on how graphs work.

Quantities can be converted into other units of measurement.
This is possible as long as 1) the values are in the same
Quantum, and 2) there is a path in the Quantum between the two.

```scala mdoc
10d *: gram in kilogram
```

Converting between quanta is not allowed, and is caught at compile time:

```scala mdoc:fail
(1 *: gram) in mile
```

## Show

A witness for the `cats.Show` typeclass is defined, `.show` will return a `String` representation.

```scala mdoc
import cats.implicits._

(10d *: gram in kilogram).show
```

## Math

Addition and subtraction are defined on Quantity by converting the
right Quantity to the unit of the left.

```scala mdoc
import spire.implicits.additiveGroupOps

(7d *: mile) - (123d *: foot)

{
  import spire.implicits._
  (1d *: kilogram) + (10d *: gram)
}
```

Addition and subtraction between different quanta is rejected at compile time:

```scala mdoc:fail
(1d *: gram) + (2d *: foot)
```

Multiplication comes from Spire's `CModule` typeclass:

```scala mdoc
import spire.implicits.rightModuleOps

(5.4 *: second) :* 100d

(32d *: century) :* (1d/3)
```

The methods `over` and `by` are used to multiply and divide other values with units.
This behavior is not yet implemented.
