# Future Work

* Shor's algorithm
* Property test reversibility (& own inverse)
* Typeclass for "negate" (etc), Binary, CBit
* Typeclass for unindex
* Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm (D.O. for n-bits) (Oracle separation between EQP and P)
* Simon's periodicity problem (oracle separation between BQP and BPP)
* Grover's algorithm
* Quantum cryptographic key exchange
