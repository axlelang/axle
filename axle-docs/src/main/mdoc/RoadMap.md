See [Release Notes](/release_notes/) for the record of previously released features.

## 0.5.4 A bit more theory (Fall 2020)

* Sampler
  * `Sampler[ConditionalProbabilityTable]` cache `bars`
  * Axioms
    1. ProbabilityOf(RegionEq(sample(gen))) > 0?
    2. In the limit, sampled distribution converges to model's

* `SigmaAlgebra` for the CPT
  * Clean up expressions like `RegionIf[TWOROLLS](_._1 == 'âšƒ)`
  * Laws for `Region` ("Sigma Algebra"? [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21a85f1YS5Q))
  * `OrderedRegion` for the `Order` used in `RegionLTE` and `RegionGTE`?

* Fix third Kolmogorov law
* Optimize `KolmogorovProbabilityAxioms.combination`

* Axiom? `pm.filter(X=x).P(X=x) === 1`
* rename `ConditionalProbabilityTable`?

* Functor for CPT?
* `{CPT,TD}.tailRecM` then ScalaCheck `Monad[CPT]`

## 0.5.5 Adoption blockers (Late 2020)

* Chicklet borders / colors

* move ast view xml (how is it able to refer to `xml.Node`?)
  * ast.view.AstNodeFormatter (xml.Utility.escape)
  * ast.view.AstNodeFormatterXhtmlLines
  * ast.view.AstNodeFormatterXhtml

* Improve Gold and Angluin coverage
* `axle-core/src/main/scala/axle/lx/*.txt`

* Create a simple graph implementation so that `axle-core` can avoid including `axle-jung`

* Create `axle-png` to avoid Xvfb requirement during tests

* Fix occasional MetricSpace failure

## 0.6.x Factoring and Bayesian Networks (2021)

* Test: start with `ABE.jointProbabilityTable` (monotype `tuple5[Boolean]`)
  * factor out each variable until
  * the Alarm-Burglary-Earthquake 5-node network is reached
  * Basically the inverse of factor multiplication
  * `bn.factorFor(B) * bn.factorFor(E)` should be defined? (It errors)
  * `MonotypeBayesanNetwork.filter` collapase into a single BNN

* Laws for `Factor`

* Review `InteractionGraph`, `EliminationGraph`, `JoinTree` and the functions they power

* Consider a "case" to be a `Map` vs a `Vector`
* Consider usefulness of `Factor` in terms of `Region`

* `MonotypeBayesanNetwork`.{`pure`, `map`, `flatMap`, `tailRecR`}
* Reconcile `MBN` `combine1` & `combine2`
* Monad tests for MonotypeBayesanNetwork[Alarm-Burglary-Earthquake]

* `Bayes[MonotypeBayesanNetwork]` -- could be viewed as "belief updating" (vs "conditioning")
  * If it took a ProbabilityModel itself

## 0.7.x Compositional Game Theory (2021)

* Replace `axle.game.moveFromRandomState.mapToProb`
* Wrap `axle.IO.getLine` in `F[_]`
* Wrap `axle.IO.prefixedDisplay` in `F[_]`

* Eliminate entropy consumption of `rng` side-effect (eg `applyMove(Riffle())`)
  * "Chance" should be its own player
  * Each N bits consumed during `Riffle()` is its own move
  * Chance moves consume `UnittedQuantity[Information, N]`
* GuessRiffleSpec: use `moveFromRandomState`
* GuessRiffle.md
  * Walk through game
  * Plot distribution of sum(entropy) for both strategies
  * Plot entropy by turn # for each strategy
  * Plot simulated score distribution for each strategy

* `perceive` could return a lower-entropy probability model
  * Perhaps in exchange for a given amount of energy
  * Or ask for a 0-entropy model and be told how expensive that was

## After that

* `svgJungDirectedGraphVisualization` move to a `axle-jung-xml` jar?
  * Will require externalizing the layout to its own.... typeclass?
  * Layout of bayesian network is quite bad -- check ABE SVG

* Experiment with pandoc

* Configure makeSite to preview: previewFixedPort := Some(9999)
* Copy css using makeSite (not update-docs.sh)
* Fix markdown lint warnings
* Figure out better way to reference images in docs

* Site
  * meta tag with keywords: axle, scala, dsl, data, analysis, science, open-source, adam pingel
  * Remove jekyll from publishing pipeline
    * [sbt-site](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-site/publishing.html)
    * sbt-s3

* Move more stuff out of `axle.math`
* `axle-ast-python`
* `cats.effect` for `axle.ast.python2`

* Fix `axle.algebra.GeoMetricSpaceSpec`
* Fix `LogisticRegression` and move `LogisticRegression.md` back

* Friend of Spire

* Tests for `axle.ast`

* Factor tics and tics-{joda,algebra,spire} into separate libs?
* Get rid of implicit arg passing to KMeans in `ClusterIrises.md` (and KMeansSpecification)
* Demo Mandelbrot with Rational

* Fix `GeneticAlgorithmSpec`
* Featurizing functions should return HLists or other typelevel sequences in order to avoid being told # features
* Replace Finite with Shapeless's version
* Delete Finite conversions for jung (replace with NaturalTransformation?)
* Replace with Cats: FoldLeft, Bijection, FunctionPair, Endofunctor
* Define laws for Scanner, Aggregator, Zipper, Indexed, Talliable, Finite?
* Sort out MapFrom, FromStream, FromSet
* Test `axle.algebra.tuple2Field`
* `similarity` syntax for `SimilaritySpace` (see `axle.bio.*`)
* Projections of jung graphs for Finite
* kittens or magnolia
  * pattern match in FirstOrderPredicateLogic
  * subtyping for Suit and Rank
* Machinist?
* replace some refs to {CPT0,TallyDist0} with ProbabilityModel
* Type-level matrix dimension using `-Yliteral-types` and `singleton-ops` in `LinearAlgebra` typeclass
* Make the `Int` abstract in `KMeans{,Visualization}`, `LinearAlgebra`, etc

Future backlog ideas:

## Game Theory and Examples

* Factor `axle.game.moveFromRandomState` in terms of a random walk on a graph.
  * See "TODO scale mass down"
  * Compare to Brownian motion, Random walk, Ito process, ...

    * no outgoing with path in from non-zero mass monotonically increases
    * no incoming with path out monotonically decreases
  * possibly provide a version for acyclic graphs
* Iterative game playing algorithm is intractible, but shares intent with sequential monte carlo
* Think about Information Theory's "Omega" vis-a-vis Sequential Monte Carlo
