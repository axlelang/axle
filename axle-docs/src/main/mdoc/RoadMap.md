## 0.5.5 or 0.6.0 cats.effect for axle.game and control entropy side effects

* Wrap `axle.IO.getLine` in `F[_]`
* Remove from `Game`: method `probabilityDist`, `sampler`, and type params `V` and `PM[_, _]`
* Move `strategyFor` from `Game` to `strategies` argument in `axle.game` package methods
* Define `Indexed.slyce` for non-1-step Ranges
* Improve `axle.lx.{Gold, Angluin}` coverage
* `axle.laws.generator` includes generators for GeoCoordinates, UnittedQuantities, and Units

* Use interactiveMove for demo

```scala
    interactiveMove[MontyHall, MontyHallState, MontyHallOutcome, MontyHallMove, MontyHallState, Option[MontyHallMove], Rational, ConditionalProbabilityTable, cats.effect.IO](
      _ => () => axle.IO.getLine[cats.effect.IO](),
      _ => (s: String) => axle.IO.printLine[cats.effect.IO](s)
    ),
```

```scala
    // These should be part of State displaying
    evGameIO.displayMoveTo(game, evGame.maskMove(game, move, mover, observer), mover, observer)
    evGame.outcome(game, lastState) foreach { outcome =>
      evGameIO.displayOutcomeTo(game, outcome, observer)
    }
```

* Demo AI mover in docs.  AI mover takes S, not MS. How can I adapt this?
* `Game.players` is only used by `outcomeRingHeuristic`
* `Game.moverM` is only used in `axle.game.Strategies.interactiveMove`
* Simplify `GuessRiffleProperties` (especially second property)
* Remove hard-coded `ConditionalProbabilityTable` in `axle.game.Strategies.randomMove` (may need new typeclass.. `UniformDistribution`?)
* stateStreamMap only used in GuessRiffleProperties -- stop using chain?
* stateStrategyMoveStream only used in GuessRiffleProperties
* GameIO -> GameSerDe (or maybe move methods to Game trait)
  * or maybe only use w/ interactiveMove
* moveStateStream
  * rename to `moveStatePath` or `traceGame`
  * unless we give this job to `State`...
    * Record history `Seq[(M, S)]` in State (and display to user in interactiveMove)
  * stop using chain?
* Game.players should be a part of GameState?
* Display to player the elapsed moves /and/ the state diff
* The references to `movesMap` in `MoveFromRandomStateSpec.scala` illustrate a need for a cleaner way to create a hard-coded strategy -- which could just be in the form of a couple utility functions from `movesMap` to the data needed by `evGame.{moves,applyMove}` and `rm` strategy

## 0.6.1 Control Entropy Consumption

* Identify all uses of `spire.random.Generator` (and other random value generation)

* See uses of `seed` in `GuessRiffleProperties`

* Eliminate entropy consumption of `rng` side-effect (eg `applyMove(Riffle())`)
  * `Chance` should be its own player
  * Each N bits consumed during `Riffle()` is its own move
  * Chance moves consume `UnittedQuantity[Information, N]`

* Replace `axle.game.moveFromRandomState.mapToProb`

## 0.6.2 Logistic Regression

* Fix `LogisticRegression` and move `LogisticRegression.md` back

## 0.6.3 Genetic Algorithm

* Fix `GeneticAlgorithmSpec`
* Featurizing functions should return HLists or other typelevel sequences in order to avoid being told # features

## 0.6.4 Logic

* Redo Logic using Abstract Algebra

## 0.6.5

* Simple graph implementation so that `axle-core` can avoid including `axle-jung`

* `svgJungDirectedGraphVisualization` move to a `axle-jung-xml` jar?
  * Will require externalizing the layout to its own.... typeclass?
  * Layout of bayesian network is quite bad -- check ABE SVG

## 0.6.6 PNG

* `axle-png` to avoid Xvfb requirement during tests
* Chicklet borders / colors on site

## 0.6.7 AST

* move ast view xml (how is it able to refer to `xml.Node`?)
  * ast.view.AstNodeFormatter (xml.Utility.escape)
  * ast.view.AstNodeFormatterXhtmlLines
  * ast.view.AstNodeFormatterXhtml
* Tests for `axle.ast`
* `axle-ast-python`
* `cats.effect` for `axle.ast.python2`

## 0.7.x Factoring and Bayesian Networks

* Reorder Probability mdoc (Creation, Kolmogorov/Region, Sampler, Bayes, Monad)
  * Footnotes (Giry, etc)

* `{CPT,TD}.tailRecM` then ScalaCheck `Monad[CPT,TD]`
* Functor for CPT, TD

* `SigmaAlgebra` for the CPT
  * Clean up expressions like `RegionIf[TWOROLLS](_._1 == '⚃)`
  * Laws for `Region` ("Sigma Algebra"? [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21a85f1YS5Q))
  * `OrderedRegion` for the `Order` used in `RegionLTE` and `RegionGTE`?

* Measure Theory

* Test: start with `ABE.jointProbabilityTable` (monotype `tuple5[Boolean]`)
  * Factor out each variable until original 5-note network is reached
  * Basically the inverse of factor multiplication
  * `bn.factorFor(B) * bn.factorFor(E)` should be defined? (It errors)
  * `MonotypeBayesanNetwork.filter` collapase into a single BNN

* Rename `ConditionalProbabilityTable`?

* Laws for `Factor`

* Review `InteractionGraph`, `EliminationGraph`, `JoinTree` and the functions they power

* Consider a "case" to be a `Map` vs a `Vector`
* Consider usefulness of `Factor` in terms of `Region`

* `MonotypeBayesanNetwork`.{`pure`, `map`, `flatMap`, `tailRecR`}
* Reconcile `MBN` `combine1` & `combine2`
* Monad tests for MonotypeBayesanNetwork[Alarm-Burglary-Earthquake]

* `Bayes[MonotypeBayesanNetwork]` -- could be viewed as "belief updating" (vs "conditioning")
  * If it took a ProbabilityModel itself

* Review complex analysis

## 0.7.x Compositional Game Theory

* GuessRiffleSpec: use `moveFromRandomState`
* GuessRiffle.md
  * Walk through game
  * Plot distribution of sum(entropy) for both strategies
  * Plot entropy by turn # for each strategy
  * Plot simulated score distribution for each strategy

* Factor `axle.algebra.chain` in terms of well-known combinators

* Gerrymandering sensitivity
* Game theory axioms (Nash, etc)
* `axle.game`: `Observable[T]`
* move state dist stream
* "You split, I choose" as game

* `perceive` could return a lower-entropy probability model
  * Perhaps in exchange for a given amount of energy
  * Or ask for a 0-entropy model and be told how expensive that was

## After that

It's likely that a 1.0 release will be made at this time.

Future backlog organized by theme are below.
At this point Axle will have enough building blocks to do the research
that has been its goal since inception.
