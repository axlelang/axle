See [Release Notes](/release_notes/) for the record of previously released features.

## 0.5.4 Sampler Axioms + package reorg (Fall 2020)

* Sampler Axioms
  1. ProbabilityOf(RegionEq(sample(gen))) > 0?
  2. Sampled distribution converges to model's
* Pre-compute `ConditionalProbabilityTable.bars` for `Sampler` witness

* Reduce size of `axle._` package object
* Organize `axle.algebra._` package object
* `axle.laws.generator`

* `rationalProbabilityDist` is now implicitly available

* Move `factorial` from `EnrichedInt` to `axle.math`

## 0.5.5 Bugs and refactorings

* Reorder mdoc (Creation, Kolmogorov/Region, Sampler, Bayes, Monad)
* Footnotes (Giry, etc)
* Chicklet borders / colors

* Improve Gold and Angluin coverage
* `axle-core/src/main/scala/axle/lx/*.txt`

* Fix occasional MetricSpace failure
* Fix `axle.algebra.GeoMetricSpaceSpec`
* Fix `LogisticRegression` and move `LogisticRegression.md` back
* Fix `GeneticAlgorithmSpec`
* Featurizing functions should return HLists or other typelevel sequences in order to avoid being told # features

* Tics should take an argument
* Factor tics and tics-{joda,algebra,spire} into separate libs?
* Get rid of implicit arg passing to KMeans in `ClusterIrises.md` (and KMeansSpecification)

## 0.5.6 Logic

* Redo Logic using Abstract Algebra

## 0.5.7

* Simple graph implementation so that `axle-core` can avoid including `axle-jung`

* `svgJungDirectedGraphVisualization` move to a `axle-jung-xml` jar?
  * Will require externalizing the layout to its own.... typeclass?
  * Layout of bayesian network is quite bad -- check ABE SVG

## 0.5.8

* `axle-png` to avoid Xvfb requirement during tests

## 0.5.9

* move ast view xml (how is it able to refer to `xml.Node`?)
  * ast.view.AstNodeFormatter (xml.Utility.escape)
  * ast.view.AstNodeFormatterXhtmlLines
  * ast.view.AstNodeFormatterXhtml
* Tests for `axle.ast`
* `axle-ast-python`
* `cats.effect` for `axle.ast.python2`

## 0.6.x Factoring and Bayesian Networks

* `{CPT,TD}.tailRecM` then ScalaCheck `Monad[CPT,TD]`
* Functor for CPT, TD

* `SigmaAlgebra` for the CPT
  * Clean up expressions like `RegionIf[TWOROLLS](_._1 == 'âšƒ)`
  * Laws for `Region` ("Sigma Algebra"? [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21a85f1YS5Q))
  * `OrderedRegion` for the `Order` used in `RegionLTE` and `RegionGTE`?

* Measure Theory

* Test: start with `ABE.jointProbabilityTable` (monotype `tuple5[Boolean]`)
  * Factor out each variable until original 5-note network is reached
  * Basically the inverse of factor multiplication
  * `bn.factorFor(B) * bn.factorFor(E)` should be defined? (It errors)
  * `MonotypeBayesanNetwork.filter` collapase into a single BNN

* Rename `ConditionalProbabilityTable`?

* Laws for `Factor`

* Review `InteractionGraph`, `EliminationGraph`, `JoinTree` and the functions they power

* Consider a "case" to be a `Map` vs a `Vector`
* Consider usefulness of `Factor` in terms of `Region`

* `MonotypeBayesanNetwork`.{`pure`, `map`, `flatMap`, `tailRecR`}
* Reconcile `MBN` `combine1` & `combine2`
* Monad tests for MonotypeBayesanNetwork[Alarm-Burglary-Earthquake]

* `Bayes[MonotypeBayesanNetwork]` -- could be viewed as "belief updating" (vs "conditioning")
  * If it took a ProbabilityModel itself

* Review complex analysis

## 0.7.x Compositional Game Theory

* Replace `axle.game.moveFromRandomState.mapToProb`
* Wrap `axle.IO.getLine` in `F[_]`
* Wrap `axle.IO.prefixedDisplay` in `F[_]`

* Eliminate entropy consumption of `rng` side-effect (eg `applyMove(Riffle())`)
  * "Chance" should be its own player
  * Each N bits consumed during `Riffle()` is its own move
  * Chance moves consume `UnittedQuantity[Information, N]`
* GuessRiffleSpec: use `moveFromRandomState`
* GuessRiffle.md
  * Walk through game
  * Plot distribution of sum(entropy) for both strategies
  * Plot entropy by turn # for each strategy
  * Plot simulated score distribution for each strategy

* `perceive` could return a lower-entropy probability model
  * Perhaps in exchange for a given amount of energy
  * Or ask for a 0-entropy model and be told how expensive that was

## After that

It's likely that a 1.0 release will be made at this time.

Future backlog organized by theme are below.
At this point Axle will have enough building blocks to do the research
that has been its goal since inception.

## Game Theory and Examples

* Factor `axle.game.moveFromRandomState` in terms of a random walk on a graph.
  * See "TODO scale mass down"
  * Compare to Brownian motion, Random walk, Ito process, ...
  * Provide some axoms
    * no outgoing with path in from non-zero mass monotonically increases
    * no incoming with path out monotonically decreases
  * possibly provide a version for acyclic graphs
* Iterative game playing algorithm is intractible, but shares intent with sequential monte carlo
* Think about Information Theory's "Omega" vis-a-vis Sequential Monte Carlo
* Improve `axle.stats.rationalProbabilityDist` as probabilities become smaller
* SimpsonsParadox.md
* "You split, I choose" as game
* Axioms of partial differentiation
* Gerrymandering sensitivity
