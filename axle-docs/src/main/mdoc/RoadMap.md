See [Release Notes](/release_notes/) for the record of previously released features.

## 0.5.0 (August 2020)

* Move to Scala 2.12
* Changes in `axle.game` to provide `Generator` where needed, and return a `ConditionalProbabilityTable0`
* Redo `axle.stats`
  * `ProbabilityModel` typeclass (refactored from `Distribution`) including syntactic support
  * Implicitly conjurable `cats.Monad` from a `ProbabilityModel`, which supports for comprehensions via cats syntax support

  * remove `Bayes`
* `axle.quantumcircuit` package for modelling computing with quantum circuits

* Move `axle.ml.distance` to `axle.algebra.distance`
* `axle.dummy` for a handful of scanLeft calls
* Remove Spark impacts on typeclasses in `axle.algebra`. Eg: Spark's `ClassTag` requirement `map` created the difficulty:
  * `Functor`: removed and replaced with `cats.Functor`
  * `Scanner`, `Aggregator`, `Zipper`, `Indexed`, `Talliable`, `Finite`: Refactored as Kind-1 typeclasses
* Vertex and Edge projections for jung graphs
* Fix `axle.joda.TicsSpec` handling of timezones
* ScaleExp works with negative exponent
* ScalaCheck tests for
  * Group and Module of UnittedQuantity
  * MetricSpace axle.algebra.GeoMetricSpace
* `axle.ml.GeneticAlgorithm` rewritten in terms of [kittens](https://github.com/milessabin/kittens)
* `Show`, `Order`, `Eq` witnesses
  * Eq.fromUniversalEquals where applicable
  * SAM inference elsewhere
* Remove `axle.string` and `axle.show`.
  * Replace uses with `.show` from `cats.implicits` or show string interpolation
* Remove extraneous `cutoff` argument for `PCA`
* Replace Tut with MDoc
* Lawful ScalaCheck tests for
  * `Module`s in `axle.algebra`
  * `SimilaritySpace`s for `SmithWaterman` & `NeedlemanWunsch`
* Fix `Order[Card]`
* `Deck.riffleShuffle`
* `GuessRiffle` game
* `axle.algebra.etc` via `axle.algebra.EnrichedRinged`
* `bernoulliDistribution`
* `axle.stats.expectation(CPT)`
* `axle.IO` consolidates IO to `cats.effect` (eg `[F[_]: ContextShift: Sync]`)
* Create `axle-awt`, `axle-xml`, and `axle-jogl` (leaving `axle.scene.{Shape,Color}` in `axle-core`)

* Inline all versions in buils.sbt (except where used more than once)

* Move `EnrichedIterable.tally` to a `Talliable` witness
* jogl tests
* `svgJungDirectedGraphVisualization` move to a `axle-jung-xml` jar?
* `federalist.txt`?

* Release jars

## 0.5.1

* MonotypeBayesanNetwork.unit (see the two nulls)
* MonotypeBayesanNetwork.map
* MonotypeBayesanNetwork.flatMap
* Reconcile combine1 and combine2 (maybe add to typeclass or trait)
* ScalaCheck `Monad[ProbabilityModel]` (needs missing tailRecM mehod)
* Monad tests for Alarm-Burglary-Earthquake as MonotypeBayesanNetwork

## 0.5.2

* Test: start with `ABE.jointProbabilityTable` (monotype `tuple5[Boolean]`)
  * factor out each variable until
  * the Alarm-Burglary-Earthquake 5-node network is reached
  * Basically the inverse of factor multiplication
  * `bn.factorFor(B) * bn.factorFor(E)` should be defined? (It errors)
  * `MonotypeBayesanNetwork.filter` collapase into a single BNN

* Review `InteractionGraph`, `EliminationGraph`, `JoinTree` and the functions they power

* Consider a "case" to be a `Map` vs a `Vector`
* Consider usefulness of `Factor` in terms of `Region`

## 0.5.3

* Replace `axle.game.moveFromRandomState.mapToProb`
* Wrap `axle.IO.getLine` in `F[_]`
* Wrap `axle.IO.prefixedDisplay` in `F[_]`

## 0.5.4

* Eliminate entropy consumption of `rng` side-effect (eg `applyMove(Riffle())`)
  * "Chance" should be its own player
  * Each N bits consumed during `Riffle()` is its own move
  * Chance moves consume `UnittedQuantity[Information, N]`

* GuessRiffle.md
  * Walk through game
  * Plot distribution of sum(entropy) for both strategies
  * Plot entropy by turn # for each strategy
  * Plot simulated score distribution for each strategy

## 0.5.5+

* MonotypeBayesanNetwork.filter -- could be viewed as "belief updating" (vs "conditioning")
  * If it took a ProbabilityModel itself
  * Is there a way of seeing this as flatMap, though?
* `observe` could return a lower-entropy probability model
  * Perhaps in exchange for a given amount of energy
  * Or ask for a 0-entropy model and be told how expensive that was

* Measure Theory

* Laws for `Region` ("Sigma Algebra"? [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21a85f1YS5Q))
* Laws for `Factor`
* `OrderedRegion` for the `Order` used in `RegionLTE` and `RegionGTE`?
* More diversity of `Region` (vs just `RegionEq`) for probability axiom (Kolm. & Bayes) tests
* Clean up expressions like `RegionIf[TWOROLLS](_._1 == '⚃)`

* Axiom for observe: val a = observe(gen) => ProbabilityOf(RegionEq(a)) > 0
* Axiom? pm.filter(X=x).P(X=x) == 1
* Fix third Kolmogorov law
* Optimize `KolmogorovProbabilityAxioms.combination`

* rename `ConditionalProbabilityTable`?
* Get rid of `implicit val prob = ProbabilityModel[ConditionalProbabilityTable]`
* "marginalize out" as "sumOut" in `ProbabilityModel` typeclass?

* Use sbt-ci-release (rm sbt-release)
* Friend of Spire

* Redo Logic using Abstract Algebra

* axioms of partial differentiation

* Tests for `axle.ast`

* Define laws for Scanner, Aggregator, Zipper, Indexed, Talliable, Finite?
* Sort out MapFrom, FromStream, FromSet
* Test `axle.algebra.tuple2Field`
* Kind projector instead of `type F[T] = ConditionalProbabilityTable[T, Rational]` and `CPTR[T]` ?
* Kind projector instead of type lambdas
* `similarity` syntax for `SimilaritySpace` (see `axle.bio.*`)
* Kind projector for projections of jung graphs for Finite
* Functors for jung should use projections (study cats disjunction, scala Either)
* kittens or magnolia
  * pattern match in FirstOrderPredicateLogic
  * subtyping for Suit and Rank
* Machinist?
* replace some refs to {CPT0,TallyDist0} with ProbabilityModel
* Update Spire (to match cats version)
