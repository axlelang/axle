# Road Map

See [Release Notes](ReleaseNotes.md) for the record of previously released features.

* Look for opportunities to use `mdoc:silent`
* Copy some test cases to QuantumCircuits.md
* Simplify "Installation"
* Make dependencies clear in each section

* Writing
  * A few words in README for each section
  * Introduction
    * Write "Objectives"
    * Smaller images for Gallery
  * Foundation
    * Architecture
    * Functional Programming
    * Scala
    * Cats: Show, EQ, IO, Algebra, Spire
    * rename "Spokes"
    * rename "Resources"
  * Units
    * Quanta: fix Distance, Energy, Time links

* tweet / post

* `laikaIncludeAPI := true` in `build.sbt`
* look at more of [these options](https://planet42.github.io/Laika/0.18/03-preparing-content/03-theme-settings.html)* Meta tag with keywords: axle, scala, dsl, data, analysis, science, open-source, adam pingel
* Timestamp / version to site footer
* GitHub "Releases" in sidebar should show "latest"
* update google analytics version
