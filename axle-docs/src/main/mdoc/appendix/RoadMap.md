# Road Map

See [Release Notes](ReleaseNotes.md) for the record of previously released features.

## CICD

* move much of Road Map to chapter-specific "future work" sections
* move GeoCoordinates.md to "Units"

* gallery images should be same width

* look for opportunities to use `mdoc:silent`
* make dependencies clear in each section
* rename "Spokes"
* more exposition for Architecture, FP, Scala, Cats
* simplify "Installation"
* copy some test cases to QuantumCircuits.md
* Reorder Probability mdoc (Creation, Kolmogorov/Region, Sampler, Bayes, Monad)
  * Footnotes (Giry, etc)

* document Quantum Circuits
* tweet / post

## 0.6.4

* stop hard-coding PDF_VERSION n build.sbt
* `laikaIncludeAPI := true` in `build.sbt`
* look at more of [these options](https://planet42.github.io/Laika/0.18/03-preparing-content/03-theme-settings.html)
* README: data sets from `axle.data` (Astronomy, Evolution, Federalist Papers, Irises)
* what to do about empty right sidebars? convert bullets into sections? disable somehow?
* update google analytics version
* merge mdoc and site directories?
* site build via github action?
