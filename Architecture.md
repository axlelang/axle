Axle generally strives to follow the patterns established
by the [Typelevel](http://typelevel.org/) projects.

With few exceptions, the functions are side-effect free.

The typeclass patterns are drawn from two traditions:

1. [Typeclassopedia](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia)
2. Abstract Algebra

The algorithms are increasingly defined only in terms of these typeclasses.
Concrete runtime implementations will require witnesses that map non-Axle data structures
onto the typeclass methods and laws.
Laws are organized into a separate `axle-laws` jar for use in tests by code that builds
upon these typeclasses.
Many such witnesses are provided by Axle for native Scala collections.

Witnesses are also defined for other common jars from the Java and Scala ecosystems.

## Remaining Design Issues

See the [Road Map](/road_map/) for more details on the timing of upcoming changes.
